        <h4>This is my first post in my page. <br> 
            IÂ´m not a professional on this. <br>
            And I will talk about my day to day life in high school.
        </h4>
        
        <p class="days"> Every school day is amazing, I usually have such a great time with my friends and classmates. Although it is also a bit tiring. There are a lot of projects and homework. </p>
        
       <h2 id="a day"> A day at CIDEB</h2>
       <p class="day-by-day">There are usually a lot of jobs, but it's nothing that is impossible. <br>
       While it is difficult, by adjusting your time it is possible.<br>
If you don't leave all your tasks at the end, most days you will be at ease. </p>
        
       <h2 id="semester"> My first semester</h2>
       <p id="very">At the beginning it was very complicated, I was really confused about everything. It's a different way of grading than in high school. High school is so different and new, but fun.</p>
